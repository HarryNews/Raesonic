		Raesonic ("Raesonic" or the "Site") is a web application provided to you by the Raesonic team ("we", "our" or "us"), that allows its users to listen to their favorite music, and discover new tracks through user-created recommendations. Video and audio content, available on the Site, is provided by the third parties (together, the "Third-Party Content"), and the use of it adheres to the restrictions stated in these terms (the "Terms of Service").
